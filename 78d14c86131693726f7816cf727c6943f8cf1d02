      "message": "Oof, I was about to ask the same thing since I managed to skim over this in the last two review rounds 😞\n\n@Sasha: the reason why this is important is that we want code run by Bazel to be side-effect free so that we can guarantee that we don\u0027t cache things that shouldn\u0027t be (for example, code executed by loadGenerated() could update .rbc files that were already read or somesuch)\n\n@Chris: $(shell) is indeed an unfortunate situation. There is a way for Make to execute arbitrary shell code during the evaluation of the Makefile before any \"actions\" get executed. I assume this is to cater for that use case? I was hoping this doesn\u0027t exist, at least not in the product configuration. Am I being wildly optimistic here?",
