When A B C depend on M the generated build rule  would be \"{A,B,C}.jar : boot-{A,B,C}.{art,odex,vdex}, which leads to 3xN^2 of dependency edges.\nIf we have one tiny module for each file and a phony module P (or the first \"boot-*.art\") to represent the whole set of files, then A B C would depend on P and P would depend on boot-{A,B,C}.{art,odex,vdex}. The generated build rule would be \"{A,B,C}.jar : P AND P : boot-{A,B,C}.{art,odex,vdex}\", which leads to 4xN dependency edges.\n\nBut I\u0027d also like to point out that as the number of files in the boot image isn\u0027t that big to begin with, this difference is probably neglectable.\nSo all that being said, I don\u0027t have a very strong opinion. I could change this to generate one module per boot image per arch, or just one module per boot image (one module to include both arch)?",
