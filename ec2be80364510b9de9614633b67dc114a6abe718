Put the .txt files under $OUT_DIR at some very simple path (if Soong/Make can do that), e.g. out/soong/apitxts/\u003cfile\u003e and put in scary comments to both places where that is specified and a test case\n\nB. Use the trick to call \"ninja -t query\" above tot determine them. Then it would look like this:\n\n1. User calls \"update_api.sh foobar\"\n2. update_api.sh calls \"m foobar-txt-files\"\n3. update_api.sh calls \"ninja -t query foobar-txt-files\" and digs the name of the .txt file under $OUT_DIR by shell hackery and under the source tree... dunno, either by transforming the path of the .txt file under $OUT_DIR or by reading a file that Ninja conveniently writes somewhere in a dependency of foobar-txt-files?\n4. update_api.sh copies the files to the source tree\n\nOr, with the legacy method:\n1. User calls \"m foobar-update-current-api\"\n2. foobar-update-current-api has a dependency on foobar-txt-files\n3. foobar-update-current-api calls update_api.sh --do_not_run_m foobar\n4. update_api.sh emits a big fat warning about being called the wrong way\n5. update_api.sh does the same thing as when called directly except without the \"m\" call (i.e. steps (3) and (4) above). This implies that \"ninja -t query -f \u003cfile\u003e\" works also when called from \"ninja -f \u003cthe same file\u003e\", but I hope it does?\n\n...or just make the legacy method error out and print a command for the user to execute. That\u0027s way less headache.",
